We explore the concept of a coin that would be backed by a large basket of goods and services. This exercise is aimed at illustrating the relative value of baskets of goods and services as compared to major currencies.

To move this project forward, the next steps are:
--> define a larger basket of goods and services
--> find reliable APIs to get regular price updates on each value in the basket
--> plot them in a live chart.
